#Created using CSC310 lecture slides and Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich et. al.

##Question 1###
#Write an insertion-sort program using a priority queue implemented with a sorted list.
#Note that follow a Priority Queues lecture slide pp. 12-13.
#The InsertionSort.py program requires double_linked_base.py, postional_list.py, priority_queue_base.py, and
#SortedPriorityQueue.py to function 
#To run this program you must create a sorted priority queue, then create a list of numbers,
#afterwards you must call the insertion_sort function which will return a sorted list of numbers

###Question 2###
#Implement a program which returns i) inorder and ii) preorder traversal of a given a binary tree. 
#Note that you should follow the code fragment style to create your program below and can use recursive 
#(or iterative) function. 
#To run this program you must declare the tree by first declaring the level 0 root node, then you 
#must delcare each node after that by saying if it is to the right or left, skipping any nodes that are null.
#After setting up your tree, pass it through the the inorder and preorder traversal methods to have an int
#list returned with the correct traversal
